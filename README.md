# CR-10-V2-Plus---Klipper-Config
My personal config of klipper for this model.
Please refer to my reddit posts linked below for the explanation attached to this config, this is mereley an adaptation that has worked for me so far and is still in the process of being tweaked.

Remember to set you Z-offset and run the necessary configuration, what is included is just my own autogenerated results and they are not current as I wipe the mesh every time.
